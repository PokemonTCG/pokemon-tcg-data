This is the data found within the [Pokémon TCG API](https://pokemontcg.io/). Currently, the raw JSON files and PNG images for all the card information can be found here.

# Downloading the data

The easiest way to stay up to date and interact with the data is via the [Pokémon TCG API](http://pokemontcg.io/) and one of the associated SDKs. Otherwise, feel free to clone this repository or download a zip from the releases.
